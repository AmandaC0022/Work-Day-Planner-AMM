# Work-Day-Planner-AMM

## Description 
With this webpage, you can keep up with all of your events during the workday. The table is interactive. When you hover over a cell, it lights up yellow. When you click on any event cell, you can add test. Once you click the save image, it will save the input. Even if you refresh the page, your input will still be displayed! An added feature, is the current time row is shown in medium blue. Dark blue shows that time has already passed, and lightblue shows that it is in the future. If you would like to delete any inputs, just click the save button again and refresh the page. The input will be blank. If you would like to change any inputs, click on the input (background will be yellow), type in your new input, and click save. Ta Da!
